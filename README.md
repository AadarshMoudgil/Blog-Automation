# ðŸ¤– Blog Automation with AI + Social Media Posting

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Built an AI Automation system for a client to streamline blog promotion.  
A WordPress webhook captures the blog title and link, then ChatGPT generates platform-specific introductions.  
Using API integrations, the system automatically posts the content to LinkedIn and Facebook.  

The client now only needs to publish on WordPress, saving time and ensuring consistent cross-platform promotion.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Publishing blogs on their WordPress-based React website
